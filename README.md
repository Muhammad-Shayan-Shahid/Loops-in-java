Java Loops Practice 🔥
Welcome to the Java Loops Playground! 🚀
This repository contains multiple examples of loop implementations in Java — from basic to slightly complex — using different types of loops:

🧠 What You'll Learn
✔️ How to use for, while, and do-while loops in Java
✔️ Loop-based logic-building examples
✔️ Nested loops 🔄
✔️ Pattern printing ✨
✔️ Control flow using break and continue
✔️ Best practices and clean code formatting 🧹

🚀 Sample Code Highlights
✅ ForLoopExamples.java
java
Copy
Edit
for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    System.out.println("Number: " + i);
}
✅ PatternPrinting.java
java
Copy
Edit
for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    for(int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
        System.out.print("* ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
